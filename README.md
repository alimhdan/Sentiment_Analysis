# Random Forest for Sentiment Analysis from Twitter Crawling Data
Random Forest for sentiment analysis from Twitter Crawling with sentence specification "Kenaikan Harga BBM"

# Introduction
This project started from the issue of increased fuel prices in early April in Indonesia. Many people complain about this. So, I decided to make this project to research how the public sentiment regarding this issue.

# Result 
In this project, I used the data from crawling data on Twitter with the sentence specification is "kenaikan harga bbm". From crawling data on Twitter, collected 1000 rows of data (tweets). After collecting data, I must to preprocessing this data to get clear data before used in Sentiment Analysis.

# Data Preparation

# Random Forest 
In this project, I divided the dataset with the proportion of 70% for train data and 30% for test data. Here are the results of the performance Random Forest Classification:
